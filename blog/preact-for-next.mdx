I ran across [@\_developit](https://twitter.com/_developit)'s
[nextjs-preact-demo](https://github.com/developit/nextjs-preact-demo)
a while ago, and being a fan of [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact)
and reducing the javascript we ship to production in general, I was super excited
to see that it didn't take much to get up and running with Preact in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
I gave it a go and was overall happy with the final result.

Revisiting this recently with the release of Next.js 10 the approach taken seems
to need some updating. Don't fear, we have a simpler way to utlize Preact in
production while retaining the amazing dev experience Next.js provides out of the box.

The previous approach in [nextjs-preact-demo](https://github.com/developit/nextjs-preact-demo)
attempts to replace React throughout the whole stack, server and client, development and production.
In this guide we will be replacing React with Preact in producton builds only on the client.
This keeps us away from react-ssr-prepass and server side rendering internals of Next.js, replacing
only the part that affects the end user.

Since Next.js provides us an easy way to customize the webpack config that is used, to accomplish
this all we have to do is use webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias)
configuration to swap React with Preact.

Start by installing preact:

```
yarn add preact
```

Then modify or create a next.config.js file that mimics:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // replace react with preact only in client production builds
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
        react: "preact/compat",
        "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
        "react-dom": "preact/compat",
      });
    }

    return config;
  },
};
```

That's all there is to it. You will want to keep an eye on production builds to make sure
you are not utilizing any unsupported React features. These are documented at
https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/differences-to-react.
